## Introduction
This is the repository for the **5-Day Gen AI Intensive Course with Google**

### What is the 5-Day Generative AI Intensive?
This is a 5-day online course from November 11 to November 15, designed to help you deeply understand some of the fundamental technologies and techniques behind Generative AI. Created by a team of Google’s ML researchers and engineers, this program includes both in-depth theoretical insights and practical coding examples, enabling you to confidently tackle new Generative AI projects.

## Course Content
- **Day 1: Foundational Models & Prompt Engineering**
  - Explore the evolution of large language models (LLMs), from transformers to techniques like fine-tuning and inference acceleration. Learn the art of prompt engineering to optimize interactions with LLMs.

- **Day 2: Embeddings and Vector Stores/Databases**
  - Learn about the theoretical foundations of embeddings and vector databases, including embedding methods, vector search algorithms, real-world applications with LLMs, and their trade-offs.

- **Day 3: Generative AI Agents**
  - Understand how to build sophisticated AI agents by learning their core components and iterative development processes.

- **Day 4: Domain-Specific LLMs**
  - Dive into the creation and application of specialized language models like SecLM and Med-PaLM, with insights from the researchers who developed them.

- **Day 5: MLOps for Generative AI**
  - Discover how to adapt MLOps practices for Generative AI and leverage Vertex AI tools for foundational models and generative AI applications.

## Notes and Resources
- Lecture notes and relevant materials will be added here daily throughout the course.
- Example code, experimental results, and personal insights will also be shared in this repository.
